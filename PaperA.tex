\title{Architectural and sociological analysis of the Swedish peri-urban
areas : past, present and perspectives}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
We proceed to a description of the Swedish peri-urban areas, first
from the historical point of view of their development and of their
architectural description. Then we propose a sociological diagnosis
around the existence of the Swedish ``suburb'', and finally we review
some perspectives on the future of these areas.

After 1960 began an other area in the implication of the State in
dwelling buildings, since a strong lack of the global quantity of
dwellings was constated. After the war, Sweden followed a quick urbanization
process, but the infrastructure was not ready to face such an increase
in demand.
